## What are solitary bees?
There are thousands of bee species in the world and dozens in the Wasatch Front alone; these bees do not build large colony hives like the European Honeybee (_apis melifera_) but instead have a number of nesting strategies, including digging into the ground, chewing through wood, or occupying existing small holes.  The latter are known as cavity nesting bees.  The mothers will create nests in small holes they find, each containing a small number of offspring.  These nests are capped off and pupate overwinter, emerging in the spring to begin the cycle anew.  The housing we create here provide nesting sites for these bees, who are critical pollenators of native and introduced plant species.

Many of these bees do not sting humans, or will only sting if actively harassed (and those that do sting are a mere pinch, a fraction of a honeybee's sting).

## Making a solitary bee house

### Installing Bee Houses
During the year, different species of solitary bees will seek out spaces to lay their eggs in.  They are looking for small holes, such as those bored in a rotting tree or our paper straws; no bait is required as they naturally seek out these nesting sites.

Find a firm structure such as a tree, fence post, your house or shed, or another sturdy location.  Affix the house with twine, tape, etc so that it do not blow around in the wind.  You could tack the cardboard backing to side of a structure.  There is some variance in their preferences, so you may wish to experiment with locations if you aren't getting any to nest.  Some general tips for the location:
* Sunny spots are preferable, but not one that bakes in the summer heat (the small houses do not have the insulation of a large log)
* If the entrance is angled slightly down, it will prevent rain from intruding and flooding them
* One study indicated north facing housing may be ideal for reduced summer baking and wind resistance

### Observing your bee houses 
When the bees choose the nesting site, they will create a series of small cells containing a single egg each, surrounded by pollen to feed the emerging larvae.  Leafcutter bees will construct these out of leaf pieces they gather, and mason bees will use mud.  On hatching, the larvae will consume the pollen and form a cocoon to overwinter in.  You will see the tubes capped off when they have been filled with these nest cells.

### Wintering Your Bees
While you can leave the bee houses where they are, their dense population and environmental exposure may make them vulnerable to predators and disease.  You may take some steps to preserve the cocoons and prepare them for spring, gaining some fun insight into the reproductive cycle in the process.

When the straws are capped off at the end of summer, you can remove the houses and store them somewhere dry and cool for the winter as they lay dormant, such as a corner of a shed, or even placing the straws in a breathable container in your fridge.  When the weather becomes warm again, they will begin the process of developing.
