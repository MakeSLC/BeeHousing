1. Ensure the tube has a backing
2. Stuff the straws so that they touch the back and do not come out further than the tube
3. Stuff any remaining space with mulch or other packing material

## Installing Bee Houses
Wrap them against a firm structure with twine, tape, etc so that they do not blow around.  You can also glue them to side of your house.  The north side might work better but you can experiment.

## Winterizing Bee Houses
When winter comes and the straws have been sealed off by the mother bees, you can take it down to protect it from snow and place it somewhere safe and dry in your garage or shed.  The bees will emerge in spring.  An emergence box can help, see pictures below (TB)D
